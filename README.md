# Description
the agent is the llm itself 
the action is the is the next word in the sequence of tokens 
the reward is 1 for a correct response and 0 for a incorrect response; this denotes the coherency of the action given the input state
the policy is the probability of taking an action for the current state of the agent

The state of the current iteration i are the tokens completed by the LLM up until i and action is the next token or next word that the LLM is predicting
s0 is always the prompt 
a0 is the subject of the prompt 
sN is always the aN of the previous state 
Likewise, aN is always what the LLM receives in the prompt for the next iteration

LLMs are models that give the probability of the next given token

# TODO
The model is currently under-trained and under-powered; output currently has the <UNK> tokens
Why the Model Behaves Like This

Tokenizer is word-level and coarse

Every out-of-vocab token becomes <UNK>. That‚Äôs why your input ‚ÄúMilky Way‚Äù becomes <UNK> the <UNK> way.

With only ~3,300 vocab tokens, it just doesn‚Äôt capture enough.

Training corpus may not align with your goal

If most of the text is story-like (e.g. Project Gutenberg books), the model learns to talk about ‚Äúdoctors, kings, monkeys‚Äù rather than science.

Small model capacity

d_model=384, 6 layers, 6 heads, ~30‚Äì40M params ‚Üí too small for rich reasoning tasks like explaining astronomy.

Training regime was shallow

Likely just LM objective, a few epochs. No fine-tuning on Q&A or reasoning datasets, so chain-of-thought prompts don‚Äôt land.

üöÄ Steps to Improve Performance
A. Fix Tokenization

Replace your word-level tokenizer with subword BPE/WordPiece (e.g. HuggingFace‚Äôs tokenizers library).

This eliminates <UNK> and handles rare words like ‚ÄúMilky‚Äù smoothly.

You‚Äôll retrain vocab (~20k‚Äì50k tokens) from your corpus.

B. Expand Model Size

Go larger: at least d_model=768, 12 layers, 12 heads (~110M params).

Still small compared to GPT-style, but a big jump in expressive power.

C. Train Longer & Better

Current training script is limited: 5 epochs, small batch size.

Increase:

epochs (20‚Äì50+ depending on corpus size),

batch size (if GPU allows),

sequence length (up to 1024+).

Use gradient accumulation if GPU memory is tight.

D. Train on the Right Data

Add corpora relevant to your goals:

Wikipedia, textbooks, Q&A data for science/math.

Reasoning-specific datasets: GSM8K, AQuA, StrategyQA (chain-of-thought style).

Clean/remove noisy text (random Project Gutenberg chatter isn‚Äôt helpful).

E. Fine-Tune for Reasoning

After pretraining, fine-tune on reasoning traces:

Q: What is the Milky Way?
Reasoning: The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy. It appears as a band of stars in the night sky because we live inside it.
Answer: It is the galaxy containing our Solar System.


Even a few thousand high-quality examples boosts performance.

F. Improve Inference

You already added CoT + self-consistency.

Next steps:

Use temperature decay (higher at first, lower later).

Add length penalty in beam search to avoid loops.

Post-process to strip <START>/<END>/<UNK> tokens.

üìà Roadmap for You

Short-term (days)

Switch to BPE tokenizer ‚Üí retrain vocab.

Re-train your model with more diverse data.

Strip <UNK> from outputs (decode cleanup).

Medium-term (weeks)

Scale model (d_model=768, 12L).

Train longer on a larger, mixed corpus.

Fine-tune with reasoning/Q&A datasets.

Long-term (months)

Add external tools (math, search) to inference.

Implement retrieval-augmented training (RAG) for factual grounding.

Explore reinforcement fine-tuning for reasoning quality.


# MULTI-AGENTIC MODULE TODO
1. Centralized Multi-Agent System To-Do
- Define the Orchestrator: Create a central agent that will receive user queries, break them down into sub-tasks, and manage the workflow. This agent is responsible for calling other specialized agents.  
- Design Agent Roles: Identify the specific tasks required for your use case and create an agent for each role (e.g., Researcher Agent, Writer Agent, Fact-Checker Agent). Each agent will be a separate instance of your LLM with a specific system prompt.  
- Integrate Tools: Wrap your RAG system and other external services (like a search tool or a database) into callable functions. These functions will be the "tools" that your agents can use.  
- Implement Tool Calling Logic: Enable the orchestrator and specialized agents to use the tools. This involves setting up function calling or a similar mechanism so the agents can trigger external actions.  
- Create the Main Control Loop: Build a loop where the orchestrator receives the user query, delegates tasks, collects results, and synthesizes the final response. This loop ensures the entire process runs from start to finish.  
- Handle Errors and Communication: Implement a way for agents to communicate back to the orchestrator about success or failure, and for the orchestrator to handle any errors that occur.  

2. Decentralized Multi-Agent System To-Do
- Define Agent Roles and Communication Protocols: Create specialized agents just like in the centralized system, but with clear protocols for how they will communicate with each other directly. There is no single orchestrator.  
- Enable Peer-to-Peer Communication: Implement a message passing system or a shared state that allows agents to send information to and receive information from each other. This is a crucial difference from the centralized model.  
- Implement a Shared Memory/State: Use a shared data store to manage the state of the task and the conversation. All agents will have access to this memory to track progress and share results.  
- Design Task Hand-off Logic: Instead of a central orchestrator, each agent will need to have logic to determine which other agent should handle the next step. This could be based on the type of information received or the current state of the task.  
- Implement a Final Agent: Design a final agent that is responsible for gathering the output from all the other agents and formatting it into a final, coherent response for the user.  
- Consider a Hierarchical Structure: For more complex tasks, you might want to create a hierarchical system where a higher-level "manager" agent oversees a team of subordinate agents, but still without a single central orchestrator for the entire system.
